# tree-sitter-tracinglog
Simple tree-sitter grammar for logs. This was designed for highlighting logs generated by the `tracing`
widely used by Rust projects.


The highlighter has support for the basic structure of a log in addition to some special types such
as IP addresses, strings, and UUIDs, but more could easily be added.
